# Cloud Computing

*These are the notes from the Microsoft's course on Cloud Computing. 
All the credit for the info goes to Microsoft, and all the credit for the effort goes to [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anastasia-sosnovskikh/).*

*Note:* since it is based off of Microsoft's course, the material is tightly tied to Azure.
